# calculator
Create a calculator to bring together everything learned in the Web Foundations course.

Assigment:
1. Create add, subtract, multiple and divide functions
2. Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
3. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.
4. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… you should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.
5. Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an operator, and also save which operation has been chosen and then operate() on them when the user presses the “=” key.
